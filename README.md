# SPA RAW

    This is my best approach to a Custom Single Page Application made from scratch.


Keen features about this repo:

  - Full PHP7.+ strength .
  - Lightweight UI/UX client focused interface.
  - Simple & Fast building DB structure.


This repo is intended as a trainig source for custom and freshly baked functions to implement complex modules in simple scripts dedicated to build and impressive, low-budget applications based on the popular Angular / Node 'Groundrules'  but avoiding all the complex serverside (also beneficial) heavy code implementations.

    We consider this, vanilla dashboard waiting for your creativity to light it up in short time, all the interface functiond have been build so you can start making content.

We are packing botch client and API in the same repo to avoid having to fork different repos at the same time. But the totally work on separate standalone servers.


# REQUERIMENTS

  - Webserver tested on Apache2, PHP7.3, MariaDB10.1

  
# INSTALLATION

  - API folder works separate just remove it from repo and paste it on the server you choose 
  - In case of working the API as Standalone server you must edit Index.html 'apiURI' variable which must be a path to the correct api URL. 
  - API folder contains .SQL dump you should run, and also /api/assets/scripts/ contains the conn.php script with database credentials. 

This is work in progress, intended to become a mobile app with custom notification system with improved client interactions so the system allows to extract large ammounts of data from the application behavior itself.
